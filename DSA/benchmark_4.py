Sorting

"""
Mergesort
  - Describe how mergesort works at a high-level.
  A: Core objective is two fold. First splitting the entire input into smaller and smaller 
  sub problems, where sub problems are inputs that are already sorted. so the base case being a 
  single item. The second fold is merging two sub-problems (sorted lists) together. This is a 
  divide & conquer algorithm, it uses extra linear space.
  - What is the runtime? Describe why itâ€™s O(n log n).
  A: Best case: O(n log n), avg case: O(n log n), worst case O(n log n)
