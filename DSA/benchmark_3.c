/*
  Implement Hashmap
  - The constructor should specify a max size for the hashmap.
  - Implement get/put operations.
  - Implement your own hashfunction. Donâ€™t worry too much about getting an
    ideal hash function, anything to start will work.
  - You can assume the keys are strings and values are integers. Mention this
    in the typing of your functions.
  - Please implement the collision handling using separate chaining (linked
    lists)
  - Do not worry about resizing for now.
  - If you exceed the max size, just reject the new value and print an error.
  - Write unit tests for this to verify that it works.
  - Modify the FixedHashMap implementation to use open addressing (linear
    probing) instead of separate changing. Implement put, get, remove. If a
    collision occurs, probe sequentially until an empty slot is found. Extend
    your Hashmap to track the smallest and largest keys efficiently without
    scanning all keys on each request.
