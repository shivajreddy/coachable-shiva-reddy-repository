/*
Implement Hashmap
 - The constructor should specify a max size for the hashmap.
 - Implement get/put operations.
 - Implement your own hashfunction. Donâ€™t worry too much about getting an ideal
   hash function, anything to start will work.
 - You can assume the keys are strings and values are integers. Mention this in
   the typing of your functions.
 - Please implement the collision handling using separate chaining (linked
   lists)
 - Do not worry about resizing for now.
 - If you exceed the max size, just reject the new value and print an error.
 - Write unit tests for this to verify that it works.

 - Modify the FixedHashMap implementation to use open addressing (linear
   probing) instead of separate changing.
    - Implement put, get, remove. If a collision occurs, probe sequentially
      until an empty slot is found.
 - Extend your Hashmap to track the smallest and largest keys efficiently
   without scanning all keys on each request.
