"""
- Implement a Stack class with push, pop, peek operations. Everything should be implemented in O(1) worst-case runtime using a singly linked list to implement it. If you have questions about the requirements you can ask me.
- Implement a Queue class with enqueue, dequeue, peek operations all in O(1). It should use a singly linked list as well.
- Explain how a singly linked list differs from a doubly linked list. Then, implement both. Write a method for removing the last element in both implementations.
- You are given a pointer/reference to a node (not necessarily the head) in a singly linked list. Implement a function to delete that node.
- Implement a function to reverse a singly linked list iteratively. What is the time and space complexity?
- Write a function that returns the middle node of a linked list in O(n) time and O(1) space without counting the length first.
- Write a function that determines whether a singly linked list represents a palindrome. Optimize for O(n) time and O(1) space.
- What is a circular linked list? Implement a method to detect if a given linked list is circular.
- Write a function that removes duplicates from an unsorted singly linked list. What are the time and space tradeoffs?
- Given a linked list and a value X, modify the list so that all notes less than X come before nodes greater than or equal to X. Maintain the relative order of nodes.
- How do insertion and deletion differ in a doubly linked list compared to a singly linked list? Implement a class for a DoublyLinkedList with insert and delete methods.
